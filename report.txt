============================= ASSIGNMENT REPORT ============================
Assignment name is: Wildfire
My name is:         <<<Cody Smith>>>

	[USE PLAIN TEXT]
	[INSERT ANSWERS AFTER EACH QUESTION AND ADD MORE LINES AS NEEDED.]
	[MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

===== In what cases does the program run correctly?  =================
The program runs correctly in the cases where the flags provided exist
within the program and only when the values stored in those flags fall
within their defined ranges. Order does not matter when it comes to 
the arguments of this program.

===== In what cases does the program fail and how?  ==================
When invalid flag chars are supplied, or when the values attached to a flag
do not fall within the proper range defined for each flag. In my program, parse_args
directs an EXIT_FAILURE to main if any of these issues occur.

===== If applicable, what were the extra credit results?  ============
The extra credit results gave the program the ability to use a lightning flag
which inputted the percentage chance of a lightning strike to occur at a random spot.
A lightning strike is signified by the symbol '!'.

===== If applicable, describe how to run the extra credit.  ==========
Add the flag in the form -LN, with N being a value from 0-100 when launching
the program. Default value is 0.

===== How much time did I spend on the project?  =====================
20+ Hours over the span of 5 days.

===== What did I learn?  =============================================
- General version management with git.
- More sophisticated knowledge of how header files function. Putting structs and vars in header 
files was something I didn't do before. 
- Node based interactions with matrixes.
- How to parse arguments within a system that allows flags to be in ANY
order. 
- How to transfer static variables from one file to another.
- A couple more ways to do modular programming better. 
- How to properly document c files with @param, @return, @author, etc.

===== What was easy in this assignment?  =============================
The easier parts were in the beginning, processing arguments, and 
initializing a grid wasn't too difficult.

===== What gave me problems or troubles?  ============================
Cross interaction between my c files. It requires a lot of time and 
energy to think it out in an efficient way. Trying to split how
the view is shown with display mode and print mode was painful.

===== What would be the most important improvement for the project?  =
I would like better documentation on the display.c file. It was a little confusing
to interpret what it was actually doing at first.

===== What else would I have liked to do for this assignment?  =======
Have different types of trees with varying amounts of time before they fully burn out (EC Idea).
