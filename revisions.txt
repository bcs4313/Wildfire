    added method to notify view of changing variables, called notify_view. added method to display statistics, called display_stats. update() method now uses notify_view to give updates about the changes in the grid. Display mode and print mode now print the statistics that they should, using the display_stats method.

    Adjusted spread and burn_eval function to account for dynamic changes in neighbor count. Added neighbor_eval function that returns whether or not a cell qualifies as a tree neighbor.

    changed method names in header for cross-compatability. Updated initialization method in view.c to properly account for print_count setting.

    Made display_print_mode and display_overlay mode static in view.c. Updated parse_args and main in wildfire.c to deal with usage requests properly. Updated wildfire.h to include all methods that are intended to be shared.

    Removed some code in wildfire.c that was used for debugging purposes. Added file named view.c, which is responsible for controlling what is printed on the console. It is still a work in progress, only being able to display the grid ONLY in print mode.

    Made multiple functions that did not need to be global static in both spreader.c and wildfire.c. Added a parse_args method in wilfire.c, that takes the arguments placed into the program and updates the program's settings accordingly. This was done to increase program modularity.

    Updated documentation on functions in spreader.c. Spread method was modified to return a tree instead of simply modifying the array. This makes it possible to use the pre-image and post-image model for the update method. The update method was created, which applies the spread method on ALL nodes and updates them using a copy of the original array as a pre-image for the spread method to interpet.

    updated spread function to also account for trees in the BURNED, EMPTY, and BURNING states respectively.

    Added the file spreader.c. spreader.c is responsible for the methods that determine whether nodes within our grid should catch fire or not. Current Methods: The spread method determines this and modifies nodes when needed. The burn_eval method simply is there to check if a tree is burning, and the init method is used to pass static variables to spreader.c.

    Created the initialize grid method, which takes the variables parsed by getopt and creates the starting grid for our simulation. Main now prints the initialized grid. Small changes to the header file for compatability.

    Added the header file wildfire.h. The file at the moment contains a struct representing each tree cell in our grid and an enumeration of the states in the tree itself.

    Created an argument parser in main that works with the flags associated with the wildfire program. Constants and statics for these flags are now defined.
